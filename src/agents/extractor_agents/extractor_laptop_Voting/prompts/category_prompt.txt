INSTRUCTIONS:
1. For each input pair, analyse the aspect term **and** its context in the review text.
2. Choose exactly one category from the list above that best fits the aspect.
3. Keep the aspect and opinion text exactly as provided (do not correct spelling or casing).
4. If the aspect term or opinion is 'null', infer the most plausible category from the opinion, reason and context of the review.
5. Output a JSON list named `categorized_pairs`, where each object contains:
      • aspect   – the aspect term (or null)
      • opinion  – the opinion term (or null)  
      • category – one of the categories above
